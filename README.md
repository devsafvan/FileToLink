| `bot.py` | The main execution file containing the bot's core logic, message handlers, and the function for generating links. |
| `info.py`| Stores configuration variables such as API keys, bot tokens, and database credentials. **Do not commit sensitive data to the repository.** ⚠️ |
| `requirements.txt` | Lists all necessary Python libraries (e.g., `pyrogram`, `pymongo`, `aiohttp`) required to run the bot. |
| `database/` | A directory containing scripts for database interaction, including setting up MongoDB, user management, and file indexing functions. |
| `plugins/` | A directory for modular features and additional commands like `/stats`, `/broadcast`, or filters. |
| `Procfile` / `Dockerfile` | Configuration files for deployment on platforms like Heroku, Railway, or Docker, specifying the command to start the bot. |
